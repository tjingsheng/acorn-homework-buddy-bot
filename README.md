# Acorn Homework Buddy Bot

Sends automated reminders about upcoming assignments or homework.

## Bot Information

Iâ€™m your personal homework reminder bot. Schedule tasks, get timely alerts, and stay on top of assignments without stress.

## Development Setup

This setup guide walks you through installing and configuring the development environment for the project. By the end of this guide, you will have a fully functional local development setup with all necessary services running. Please follow each step carefully to ensure everything is correctly configured.

1. **Prerequisites**

   Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

   - [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) - The #1 containerization software for developers and teams
   - [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - JavaScript runtime environment
   - [**pnpm**](https://pnpm.io/installation/) - A fast and disk space-efficient package manager for JavaScript.

2. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tjingsheng/acorn-homework-buddy-bot.git
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create your local dev environment file by copying the example provided:

   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**

   Run the following to install all dependencies:

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

5. **Start the development environment:**

   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```

## SSH Configuration (Optional but highly Recommended)

To simplify repeated access to your EC2 instance, you can configure a shortcut alias called `acorn`.

1. Move Your EC2 Key File

   Ensure your `.pem` key file is stored securely in your SSH directory:

   ```sh
   mv ~/Downloads/acorn-homework-buddy-bot.pem ~/.ssh/
   chmod 400 ~/.ssh/acorn-homework-buddy-bot.pem
   ```

2. Configure the SSH Alias

   Open (or create) your SSH config file:

   ```sh
   vim ~/.ssh/config
   ```

   Add the following block, replacing the placeholder values as needed:

   ```ini
   Host acorn
      HostName ec2-XX-XX-XX-XX.ap-southeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com
      User ec2-user
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/acorn-homework-buddy-bot.pem
   ```

   - `HostName`: Your EC2 instance's public DNS or IP address
   - `User`: Use `ec2-user` for Amazon Linux, or `ubuntu` for Ubuntu
   - `IdentityFile`: Full path to your `.pem` file

   Save and exit the file (`:wq` in vim).

3. Test the SSH Shortcut (Optional)

   Once configured, test it with:

   ```sh
   ssh acorn
   ```

   If successful, you'll connect without needing to type the full hostname and path every time.

## Deployment

This method assumes you have configured the SSH alias `acorn` as described above.

Before you proceed, ensure the following are ready:

- An AWS EC2 instance is running and accessible via SSH.
- A PostgreSQL database is available and accessible from the EC2 instance.
- You have configured the required environment variables in a `.env` file.

Adjust values as needed for your environment.

From the project root, run:

```sh
pnpm ec2
```

This will build and deploy the bot to your EC2 instance using the `acorn` SSH alias.
